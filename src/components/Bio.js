      <p>
        I am a full-stack developer and recent graduate of Mathematics at the
        University of Waterloo and Business at Wilfrid Laurier University.

        A bit of backstory:
        <br /> In the not-so-distant past, I worked in risk management. It took
        working the wrong job and maneuvering a career during the pandemic to
        compel me to reflect on my academic and professional career. I realized
        that nothing ever piqued my interest quite like my computer science
        courses did. Drawing on that realization, I decided to go back to school
        to finish my math degree as my first major step towards my goal of
        becoming a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I have graduated from university, and I am excited to bring
        my skills into the workforce. Please feel free to browse my resume to
        see my education, skills, and work history in more detail.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you,</p>
      <p>Jennifer Heckel</p>
